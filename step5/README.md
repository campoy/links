# A complete application

This is a complete application, but there's so much more you could do.

To start, check out the Dockerfiles and manifest.yaml. I also left a Makefile for you
that might be helpful.

Can you run the whole thing on Kubernetes? Does it *actually* work? What is missing?
Can you fix it?
