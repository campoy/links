# gRPC gateway

By moving to gRPC we lost the capacity of serving our REST clients ...
but that doesn't need to be that way!

Following the instructions on https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway
complete the main.go file for repository/cmd/gateway as well as the corresponding
protocol buffer definitions.

After that, try to create a link using curl.
